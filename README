openssh_scp_log
===============

I just want to record the log of 'scp', but I can't find any way tool or method by google. 

The base-version is 'openssh-4.0p1'. The modifications are function-independent, so you can do the same changes in the other versions. 

If you have any better way to solve it, please send email to xichy.dong#gmail.com or xichy#126.com.
